# Drone-Delivery-System
This was the project I was involved during my Winter Internshp at IIT Bhubaneswar, 2020. The main motive was to bulid a autonomous drone vehicle that was build using Raspberry pi.
I was assigned the task to design a code that would control the drone's path avoiding all obstacles while moving from one source to destination.The code is completely Python based
involving basics of Drone flight and control. The code is tested by applying it in a simulation environment and the tracking is done using Arduipilot navigation software.
